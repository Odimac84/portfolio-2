# Introduction
![picture of how my idea was from the start](/assets/images/idea.jpg)
i tried to stay true to my plan about mainly how i wanted it to look. but some parts changed during the road. a fairly easy looking site with just one site thast holds a game built with JavaScript. 

# User experience (UX)
I went for a simple look seeing that all the page holds is a game. 2 boxes 1 with the game and one with a flowchart for rules. 
1 first section holds a fairly simple game of rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock. its a fun way to spend some time, just playing away against the computer that gets a random symbol every time. paired with this we get the information about who picked what and who won the game aswell as a counter to keep track on whos winning in the long run. 

Below this I placed a flowchart that will show the player how the winner is declared if they dont know this before they play. 

# Colors #
choice of my colors is made so that there is a softer background and then colors that will mark out the game area and the rules area.

## Possible features to add  ##

- A 2 player function where you either can choose by buttons at the same computer or play against eachother from diffrent computers. can also make this a multiplayer game if wished. 

- This can be achived by adding an AI to the game that keeps tracks of patterns, or that the computer gets the upperhand with knowing the human pick and decides who wins. 

- Adding more types of games or diffrent game types with 3 weapons or even adding more.

- best out of 7 rounds (with or without a 2 point margin for the win)



# User stories


## User ##

As a user i hope that the game is fun and that I will be able to win.

## Site Owner ##

As a site owner i only wish that the player finds the game fun, games should be fun and entertaining.

# Testing

Page has been tested in diffrent browsers and on diffrent devices such as Chrome, IE, Mozilla. Devices tried are Laptop, Desktop, Tablet, Mobile. 
The only problem I found was that mobile loads the page in a zoomed state. 

It has also passed both lighthouse and GTmetrix with flying colors.

## Further testing 

-As mentioned before one issue found is that the page loads in a zoomed state on a mobile device. i tried changing the initial-scale and one fix is to drop this to 0.4 but that break is in any other device.

Fixed this by adding by scaling the page when it goes under 500px so that it gets responsive even under this point.

Pictures both for Readme.md and the flowchart on the page has been submitted to [tinypng](https://tinypng.com/) to to reduce the size of the pictures needed to be loaded saving me 40% off the pictures size.

# Validation
 All validations done on the page has been showing zero errors as shown in the pictures below. Most of the things corrected during the project has been adding semicolons i missed but that hasent been crucial for the code to run as intended.
